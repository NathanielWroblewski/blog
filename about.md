In 2013, after graduating college with a degree in chemistry, I quit my job, sold everything I owned, and left my friends and family behind to move to San Francisco and try my hand at computer programming, a profession I'd never been exposed to before. It was the best decision I've ever made.

I am always looking for an environment where talent is cultivated, knowledge is shared, and passion is requisite.  If you'd like to get together to hack sometime, drop me a line!
